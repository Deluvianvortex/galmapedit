# galmapedit

The Galaxy Map Editor for Legacy 

Version 1

Requirements: .NET 4.5 and a computer capable of running that distro (windows definately, linux/macos probably, not others)


CHANGELOG:

Version 1: Barebones build so I can test the files in the actual game. The Help menu does nothing. You cannot import from bmp.
There may be other unreported bugs.
