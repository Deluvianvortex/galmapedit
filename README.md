# galmapedit

The Galaxy Map Editor for Legacy 

Version 1.2

Requirements: .NET 4.5 and a computer capable of running that distro (windows definately, linux/macos probably, not others)

# Quick N Dirty Tutorial

Compile the program an open the executable. 

You will see a gridview on the left. This is the Galaxy Map. Clicking on any of the gridsquares will load that particular sector
into the editor window on the right.

From there, you may see the planetary hierarchy inside the sector in the above treeview. Sectors will always have two branches - Comets and Stars. 

Comets are large pieces of ice and rock that exist beyond the gravity well of a particular star. They exist as objects inside interstellar space. Comets are filtered into the 'Comets' branch and have no child branches of their own.

Stars are large masses of hydrogen and helium that have other, smaller objects in orbit around them. A Star exists as an object in instersellar space. Stars are filtered into the 'Stars' branch and will always have at least one child branch - Planets. (Planets can be 0, but the tree will still exist)

Planets are masses of elements that exist inside the gravity well of a particular star. They exist as objects outside interstellar space. Planets are always bound to their host star, and cannot exist without one. Planets will always have at least one child branch - Moons.

Moons are masses of elements that exist inside the gravity well of a particular planet. They exist as object outside interstellar space. Moons are always bound to their host planet, and cannot exist without one. Moons will generally not have child branches.

Asteroids are masses of rock and metals that exist pretty much everywhere. They exist both as objects inside and outside interstellar space. Asteroids can be bound to host stars, planets, and moons. Asteroids will never have child branches. 

If you don't see any of these things in the treeview, its because you don't have any information loaded in the sectors. To fix that, go to File -> New -> Random, and select 'No' when it asks to save (unless you want to save a blank galaxy, you can, I'm not your mom).

Then you'll see that information appears in the sectors, in the treeview window. You can look through the hierarchies, or add/remove stellar objects by right-clicking any object in the treeview. You can also do this if you didn't want to spool a random galaxy.

If you double-click any object in the treeview, you can see that object's variables in the Editor Window. 

Work continues.

CHANGELOG:

Version 1: Barebones build so I can test the files in the actual game. The Help menu does nothing. You cannot import from bmp.
There may be other unreported bugs. 

Version 1.1: I found a horrible bug and fixed it so hopefully the thing won't crash on people anymore lol
Version 1.2: Rewrote the sorting algorithm so that its less confusing to read and also works now
             You can now add and remove asteroids in all levels of the hierarchy
             Comets now have descriptions
             You still cannot edit the information in the editor window (coming soon) but it does appear properly now
